# aescrypt-legacy

This repository contains a preserved copy of the last open source / freeware version of **[AESCrypt](https://www.aescrypt.com/)**, a file encryption utility that was widely used in the past.

The original project has since become closed-source and proprietary. This archive aims to keep the last freely licensed version available for historical, compatibility, and practical purposes ‚Äî especially for users who need to decrypt previously encrypted files using the legacy AESCrypt format.

## üì¶ About this version

- This code was recovered from [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20240814072139/https://www.aescrypt.com/download/) and corresponds to the final publicly available version before the license changed.
- No modifications were made to the code, except for minor adjustments to ensure it compiles and runs in modern environments.
- This project is **not actively maintained** and is provided strictly for archival and compatibility purposes.
